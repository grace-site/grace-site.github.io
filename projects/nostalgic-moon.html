                        I directed the short film in a team of five students. I designed the scenes and camera angles, as well as painted the digital storyboards shown in the animatics.

                        “Nostalgic Moon” is a girl’s journey in reconciling with her past - the grief of losing her mother. Inspired by the sentimental nature of full moon, the story is set in mid-autumn to evoke tender feelings and memories of family. The other side of the moon, however, is dark and mysterious, mesmerizing and curious. Such is the journey of the girl as she follows the unknown, to take the fall, and find herself. In the end when she paints the rabbit with her fingers, she rediscovers her mother within herself. The love and tenderness of her mother lives on within her.
