                        Installation with a clock, stethoscope, microphone, speaker
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        This clock has a sentimental value to me. 
                        For ten years, I grew up in Africa, and this clock has accompanied me throughout my high school years. 
                        It woke me up every morning with its beep beep beep, and shown me to sleep at night. 
                        Now, I have come back to Hong Kong, a whole eight-hour time difference. 
                        But still, I left it running. African time. It lives on. Its battery still running. Its hands still moving. Its heart still beating. But one day, it will stop.
                        <br>

                        Clockbeat is an object installation piece, composed of my personal alarm clock, with a stethoscope attached to it. 
                        The stethoscope then attaches to a microphone that records the beating of the clock. 
                        The beating is amplified and played aloud by the speakers.
