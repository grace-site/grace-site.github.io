                        A wedding invitation card designed for my friend. They wanted an orange floral themed, with English and Chinese on each side. 
                        My first step was to research print shops and their ink and paper selections, pricing options, in order to produce the appropriate
                        file type, bleed, vectors necessary, within the couple's budget.
                        After drafting out a layout and sketch for the couple's approval, I first painted the flowers digitally in Krita.
                        Then the layouts were completed in Inkscape, choosing the fonts for the titles, and tracing vector strokes for 
                        the gold foil stamping. The process involved back-and-forth editting and comments from the couple, as well as quotations and 
                        communication with the print shop.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In addition to the wedding invitation card, I also designed their banquet invitations, ceremony rundown leaflets,
                        and the couple name sign.
