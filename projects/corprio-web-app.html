                        Grace CHAN, and colleagues
                        <br>
                        Corprio Web App, 2023
                        <br>
                        A business management web software using C# Asp.Net Core MVC framework
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Working in a small company consisting of three developers, I had the creative freedom to structure the 
                        functions and logic of the application, design the look and user interface, and improve the development workflow by 
                        introducing new technologies as well as documenting the implementation.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        For example, I redesigned the Corprio Product app in terms of database architecture, business logic, and user interface.
                        In creating a product management tool that will suit businesses of different industries, I added the feature of custom unit of measures.
                        To do so, I analyzed the relationship between a product, its unit of measures,
                        the selling and purchasing prices of each of the products at the respective UOMs, and crafted new data tables to meet this requirement.
                        Then in order to ensure data integrity, I coded the API that applies rules of business logic and calculates accurate unit conversions.
                        Lastly, I designed the frontend interface to ensure it is mobile-friendly and intuitive to use, sketching out the UI before implementing
                        it in html, javascript, and css.
                    </p>

                        In addition to the designing and programming, I was also actively seeking for ways to improve the development workflow,
                        whenever I see repetitive tasks or debugging barriers. For example, when I noticed that debugging javascript within
                        the MVC framework was a pain, I turned to research a way to implement typescript in our stack. When I found out that
                        the current framework was not very compatible with the solution I was looking at, I created my own pipeline using gulp.js
                        to work around and accomplish the desired improved workflow. Afterwards, I wrote a documentation so that my colleagues
                        and future programmers would also be able to adopt this practice.

                        Besides coding, I also designed the interactive layouts, css animations, and the app icons. Check out more
