                        "Seek", 2018
                        <br>
                        Generative art created with Processing java
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        “Seek,” as if wandering the earth seeking a home.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        This piece was inspired by Casey Reas' concept of Element 1, which creates many
                        circles and draws a line between the centers of overlapping circles. The color of lines
                        depend on the line's length: the longer, the blacker. The sketch is interactive with the
                        mouse - where the mouse is, nearby circles enlarge in radii. This result in aesthetic
                        black spots that extend and spread across the canvas. The audio is composed of two
                        parts: the low, grumbling wind ambience, and the harmonious violin chords. The pitch of
                        the wind is variable based on line lengths, its amplitude based on noise and time. The
                        chord progression is based on music theory chord map. Minor and major chords are
                        chosen depending on how black the sketch appears at the moment.
