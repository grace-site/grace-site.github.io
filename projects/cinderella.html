                        AR word game, using Hololens, Unity, Python, Mixed Reality Toolkit, Vuforia, Visual Studio IDE
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Inspired by the interactive fiction "Counterfeit Monkey" by Emily Short, the game turns the world into objects manipulatable by the spelling of its name.
                        To bring this to life, augmented reality allows for an immersive and interactive experience of the game. 
                        Combined with Vuforia spatial tracking, real objects and virtual objects coexisted in this story-themed word puzzle.

                        Cinderella wants to go to the ball, but she needs a ballgown and a way to get there! Her fairy godmother left her with magic powers to transform objects.
                        The trick is this: She can combine two different words, or
                        remove any one letter from a word, and it will transform into a new object. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        For example, she can remove the P from PEAR to make an EAR by pressing the letter.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="text-wrapper">
                    <p>
                        Then she can combine EAR with RINGS to get EARRINGS for her ballgown accessories.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="two-column-wrapper">

                    <p>
                        The EARRINGS will then appear on the mannequin. Collect a complete costume and a way to travel to win the game! But be careful, you can also lose the game if you're uncareful...

                        In this project, we used Mixed Reality Toolkit in Unity to build a game that can be deployed to Hololens. 
                        Initially, we wanted to use object tracking for live interaction. 
                        But due to difficulties tracking objects reliably, we changed to using Vuforia spatial tracking to scan the room.
                        We predetermined and mapped each object to a location in the room, and interacted with the virtual object.
                        I coded the game logic in Python, programmed a system that manages the letter-word possibilities and winning conditions.
