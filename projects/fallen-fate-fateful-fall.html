                        The Eden myth of the Bible tells of the first man and woman on earth sinning against God by eating the forbidden fruit, an event known as "the fall," which plunged the world into evil and suffering. Growing up as a Christian, I had always been intrigued how it is believed that a single wrong of our ancestor could result in the curse of all humankind, to be born into sinful nature. In this piece, I explore the doctrines behind the written record through reimagining alternative story-lines and juxtaposing parallel biblical verses to reveal the implications of faith. Although the work has a religious context, I hope to create a space for all to question and re-explore our own understanding of the world.

                        You sit at a table. Before you is the Bible, opened. A monitor in front of you prompts you to start the story by flipping open to a page of the book.
                        You flip and read a passage about how one action of a human ancestor has brought evil and suffering to the world. When you finished reading from the Bible,
                        you look up and on the monitor, some text was displayed. It narrates the story you have just read about.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Except. Except this time, when the character in the story is about to make a decision, the text stops. You look up at the wall in front of you. Twelve sheets of
                        paper were mounted: each title is a theme, a database of Bible passages and their page numbers. You notice that two of these references has been lit up. It is a choice. Your choice now.
                        The two titles highlighted were "Predestination" and "Freedom." You choose one, and flip the Bible to that passage. And you read, and it is about the title you have chosen.
                        After you finished reading from the Bible, you look up and see the story continues on the screen, according to the choice you have made...
