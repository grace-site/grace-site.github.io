                        "Shower Bed" is - you guessed it - a bed that does the showering for you. 
                        On nights you feel too exhausted to take a shower, just on hop bed, and it will take care of the rest. 
                        The shower bed has too modes: a sleeping mode (where you can feel the comfort of soft cotton mattress) 
                        and a shower mode (where the bed transforms into a waterproof spray tub). 
                        The product comes with a waterproof pillow.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Just lie on the bed, then press the shower button, then the following will happen:
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        1. The permeable net is lifted from the mattress, raising the body from the bed.
                        <br>
                        2. A waterproof sheet slides between the mattress and the net, to keep the mattress from getting wet.
                        <br>
                        3. The showering blanket slides over the body.
                        <br>
                        4. On the underside of the blanket, holes spray water, soap, and drying wind for cleansing. Water is also sprayed from the sides of the bed to cover other areas of the body.
                        <br>
                        5. When the body is cleansed and dried, the showering blanket and the waterproof sheet rolls back within the bed. The net once again lower the body down on to the comfortable mattress.
