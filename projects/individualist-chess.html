                        "Individualist Chess", 2019
                        <br>
                        Mutated Chinese chess game created with Processing java
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        “Individualist Chess” is an explorational artwork based on the question, “What if in a game of chess,
                        every piece made their own decisions based on their own desires and fears, with no single
                        sovereignty?” In the work, each chess piece is its own agent within the system, driven by its desire to
                        eat others and its fear to die. The simulation unveils interesting social phenomenon in an
                        individualistic society where the lack of a central command causes the team to lose direction,
                        strategy, and cooperation. Further interesting observations could be explored by altering the values
                        of each chess piece, or even of a team. Perhaps one team’s fear-of-death value is negative,
                        comprising a suicidal society. Perhaps the society upholds equality such that the general is of no
                        greater worth than the soldier, reforming the entire goal of the traditional game. Various situations
                        are possible in each play of the work, as it is a structure for potential situations within the
                        constraints of the system. Even if all values are maintained constant, each play would still vary by the
                        randomness incorporated in each move. A small change early on in the game could change the
                        outcome drastically since the chess world is such a complex system. The scope of this artwork runs
                        from the simulation of agents to the phenomenon of a society to the values of humanity. Ultimately,
                        there is no single premise. The piece invites one to interact with the game, explore the social
                        possibilities, and examine their own worldview.

                        Each chess agent has the following behavioural rules:
                        <br>
                        1. When it is this agent's turn, it moves to the possible move that is most weighty.
                        <br>
                        2. If there are multiple possible moves that are the weightiest, choose randomly among them.
                        <br>
                        The weight of possible moves are calculated based on worth and fear-of-death values. If a possible
                        move allows the piece to eat another piece, then the worth of the eaten piece is added to the
                        weight. If a possible move puts the piece in danger of being eaten, then the fear-of-death of the
                        piece is subtracted from the weight.

                        How to Play:
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Here is a basic user manual for playing the game. There is no “goal” or “winning” in this game, but
                        rather the player is invited to play around the values and observe interesting situations and decisions
                        the game makes.
                        <br>
                        Hit SPACEBAR to view the next move.
                        <br>
                        Click NEW GAME to start over.
                        <br>
                        Click DISPLAY WEIGHT to toggle the display of the weights of the possible moves.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        To edit the worth and the fear-of-death values of the chess pieces:
                        <br>
                        1. First click on the input box
                        <br>
                        2. Type the desired value. Make sure it is an integer
                        <br>
                        3. Hit ENTER
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        When NEW GAME is clicked, all
                        chess pieces are revived at their original positions with their default worth and fear-of-death values.
